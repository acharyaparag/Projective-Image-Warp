warper.cpp warps the input image and writes into an output image
It contains the following procedures:
Reading an image : loadImage
Writing an image: writeImage
Displaying image: displayImage
warping : warp the input image
forwardMap : Calculates the bounding box size

For each operation separate routine is used:
Rotate - rotate an image
Scale - Scales the image based on the input x and y scaling factor
Translate - Translates the image based on the input x and y translation factor
Shear - Shear the image based on the input x and y shearing factor
Perspective - Creates a Perpective based on the input x(a31) and y(a32) values 
Flip - Flips the image. If x = 1 , flips the x coordinates. If y = 1, flips the y coordinates.
 
test.png is the input image
out.png is the sample ouput image created by scaling 0.5 in both the x and y directions

To run code compile using makefile(type make) and then type ./warper input_image output_image(optional)
warped image is written to output_image if it is specified else nothing is written



interactive is the executable that runs warper in interactive mode
It contains the following procedures:
Reading an image : loadImage
Writing an image: writeImage
Displaying image: displayImage
warping : warp the input image
forwardMap : Calculates the bounding box size
calcM : Computes the projective warp matrix

To run code compile using makefile(type make) and then type ./interactive input_image

When specifying the corners of the output warped quadrilateral make sure to go in anti-clockwise direction starting with the bottom left corner
First click should be the bottom left corner of the image
Second click should be the bottom right	corner of the image
Third click should be the Top right corner of the image
Fourth click should be the Top left corner of the image
